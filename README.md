 # Text Adventure Game (Python)

This is a small console-based text adventure game written in Python.

The player starts on a dirt road and must make choices in order to reach the end and win. Each choice leads to a new scenario â€” some choices move the story forward, while others result in losing the game.

 

## How It Works

- The game asks for the player's name and greets them.
- The player must choose to go **left** or **right**.
- Based on that choice, the game will ask for more decisions (e.g. swim/walk, cross/back, yes/no).
- The story ends either with a **win** or a **loss**, depending on the path the player takes.
